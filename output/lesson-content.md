### Learning Goals
- Calculate the area of a region by decomposing it and rearranging the pieces, and explain (orally and in writing) the solution method.
- Recognize and explain (orally) that if two figures can be placed one on top one other so that they match up exactly, they must have the same area.
- Show that area is additive by composing polygons with a given area.

### Student Learning Goal
Let's create shapes and find their areas.

### Learning Targets
- I can explain how to find the area of a figure that is composed of other shapes.
- I know how to find the area of a figure by decomposing it and rearranging the parts.
- I know what it means for two figures to have the same area.

### Standards
**Building on:**
- 3.MD.C.5.b: A plane figure which can be covered without gaps or overlaps by n unit squares is said to have an area of n square units.

**Addressing:**
- 6.G.A.1: Find the area of right triangles, other triangles, special quadrilaterals, and polygons by composing into rectangles or decomposing into triangles and other shapes; apply these techniques in the context of solving real-world and mathematical problems.

**Building toward:**
- 6.G.A: Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, surface area, and volume.

## Lesson Narrative
This lesson begins by revisiting the definitions for **area** that students learned in earlier grades. The goal here is to refine their definitions (MP6) and come up with one that can be used by the class for the rest of the unit. They also learn to reason flexibly about two-dimensional figures to find their areas, and to communicate their reasoning clearly (MP3).

The area of two-dimensional figures can be determined in multiple ways. We can **compose** a figure using smaller pieces with known areas. We can **decompose** a figure into shapes whose areas we can determine and add the areas of those shapes. We can also decompose it and **rearrange** the pieces into a different but familiar shape so that its area can be found. The two key principles in this lesson are:

- Figures that match up exactly have equal areas. If two figures can be placed one on top of the other such that they match up exactly, then they have the same area.
- A figure can be decomposed and its pieces rearranged without changing its area. The sum of the areas of the pieces is equal to the area of the original figure. Likewise, if a figure is composed of non-overlapping pieces, its area is equal to the sum of the areas of the pieces. In other words, area is additive.

Students have used these principles since grade 3, but mainly to decompose squares, rectangles, and their composites (e.g., an L-shape) and rearrange them to form other such figures. In this lesson, they decompose triangles and rearrange them to form figures whose areas they know how to calculate.

A note about "two figures that match up exactly": In grade 8, students will learn to refer to such figures as *congruent* and to describe congruence in terms of rigid motions (reflections, rotations, and translations). In these materials, the word congruent is not used in grade 6. A possibility is to use an informal term such as "identical," so that students can talk about one figure being an "identical copy" of another. What "identical" means, however, might also require clarification (e.g., that it is independent of color and orientation).

### Required Materials
- geometry toolkits
- pre-assembled or commercially produced tangrams

### Required Preparation
Prepare 1 set of tangrams that contains 1 square, 4 small, 1 medium, and 2 large right triangles for every 2 students. Print and cut out the Blackline Master (printing on card stock is recommended), or use commercially-available tangrams. Note that the set of tangram pieces used here differs from a standard set in that two additional small triangles are used instead of a parallelogram.

A tangram applet is included for classrooms using the digital materials, but students can also be given the option of using physical tangrams instead of the digital tool.

Make sure students have access to their geometry toolkits, which should include tracing paper, graph paper, colored pencils, scissors, and an index card to use as a straightedge or to mark right angles.

### Lesson Terms

## Warm Up: What Is Area? (10 minutes)

**Building on:** 3.MD.C.5.b
**Building toward:** 6.G.A

### Instructional Routines
- Think Pair Share

This Warm Up activates and refines students' prior knowledge of area. It prompts students to articulate a definition of area that can be used for the rest of the unit. This definition of area is not new, but rather reiterates what students learned in grades 3–5.

Before this lesson, students explored tiling and tile patterns. Here, they analyze four ways a region is being tiled or otherwise fitted with squares. They decide which arrangements of squares can be used to find the area of the region and why, and use their analysis to write a definition of area. In identifying the most important aspects that should be included in the definition, students attend to precision (MP6).

Students' initial definitions may be incomplete. During partner discussions, note students who mention these components so they can share later:

- Plane or two-dimensional region
- Square units
- Covering a region completely without gaps or overlaps

Limit the whole-class discussion to 5–7 minutes to leave enough time for the work that follows.

### Launch
Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students 2 minutes of quiet think time for the first question, and ask them to be ready to explain their decision. Then, give partners 3–4 minutes to share their responses and to complete the second question together.

### Student Work Time

#### Problem 1

You may recall that the term **area** tells us something about the number of squares inside a two-dimensional shape.

a. Here are four drawings that each show squares inside a shape. Select **all** drawings whose squares could be used to find the area of the shape. Be prepared to explain your reasoning.

A. [shape broken up into large squares]
B. [shape broken up into large and small squares]
C. [shape broken up into large squares and white space]
D. [shape broken up into small squares]

b. Write a definition of area that includes all the information that you think is important.

**Student Responses:**
a. A and D. B could be considered if the larger squares and the smaller ones are distinguished when determining area.
b. Answers vary, but the working definition should contain all of these components: "The area of a two-dimensional region (in square units) is the number of unit squares that cover the region without gaps or overlaps."

### Activity Synthesis
For each drawing in the first question, ask students to indicate whether they think the squares could or couldn't be used to find the area. From their work in earlier grades students are likely to see that the number of squares in A and D can each tell us about the area. Given the recent work on tiling, students may decide that C is unhelpful. Discuss students' decisions and ask:

- "What is it about A and D that can help us find the area?" (The squares are all the same size. They are unit squares.)
- "What is it about C that might make it unhelpful for finding area?" (The squares overlap and do not cover the entire region, so counting the squares won't give us the area.)
- "If you think B cannot be used to find area, why not?" (We can't just count the number of squares and say that the number is the area because the squares are not all the same size.)
- "If you think we can use B to find area, how?" (Four small squares make a large square. If we count the number of large squares and the number of small squares separately, we can convert one to the other and find the area in terms of either one of them.)

If time permits, discuss:
- "How are A and D different?" (A uses larger unit squares and D uses smaller ones. Each size represents a different unit.)
- "Will they give us different areas?" (They will give us areas in different units, such as square inches and square centimeters.)

Select a few groups to share their definitions of area or what they think should be included in the class definition of area. The discussion should lead to a definition that conveys key aspects of area: The area of a two-dimensional region (in square units) is the number of unit squares that cover the region without gaps or overlaps.

Display the class definition and revisit as needed throughout this unit. Tell students this will be a working definition that can be revised as they continue their work in the unit.

## Activity 1: Composing Shapes (25 minutes)

**Addressing:** 6.G.A.1

### Instructional Routines
- MLR2: Collect and Display
- Think Pair Share

In grade 3, students recognized that area is additive. They learned to find the area of a rectilinear figure by decomposing it into non-overlapping rectangles and adding their areas. Here students extend that understanding to non-rectangular shapes. They compose tangram pieces—consisting of triangles and a square—into shapes with certain areas. The square serves as a unit square. Because students have only one square, they need to use these principles in their reasoning:

- If two figures can be placed one on top of the other so that they match up exactly, then they have the same area.
- If a figure is decomposed and rearranged to compose another figure, then its area is the same as the area of the original figure.

Each question in the task aims to elicit discussions about these two principles. Though they may seem obvious, these principles still need to be stated explicitly (at the end of the lesson), as more-advanced understanding of the area of complex figures depends on them.

The terms **compose**, **decompose**, and **rearrange** will be formalized in an upcoming lesson, but throughout this lesson, look for opportunities to demonstrate their use as students describe their work with the tangram pieces. When students use "make" or "build," "break," and "move around," recast their everyday terms using the more formal ones.

As students work, notice how they compose the pieces to create shapes with certain areas. Look for students whose reasoning illustrates the ideas outlined in the Activity Synthesis.

Demonstrate the use of the word "compose" by repeating students' everyday language use and then recast using the formal terms here.

### Launch
Give each group of 2 students the following set of tangram pieces from the Blackline Master or from commercially available sets. Note that the set of tangram pieces used here differs from a standard set in that two additional small triangles are used instead of a parallelogram.

- Square: 1
- Small triangles: 4
- Medium triangle: 1
- Large triangles: 2

It is important not to give them more than these pieces.

Give students 2–3 minutes of quiet think time for the first three questions. Ask them to pause afterwards and compare their solutions to their partner's. If they created the same shape for each question, ask them to create a different shape that has the same given area before moving on. Then, ask them to work together to answer the remaining questions.

Classrooms using the digital activities can use physical tangram pieces or an applet with the same shapes to determine the relationships between the areas. Applet is adapted from the work of [Harry Drew](https://www.geogebra.org/u/hdrew) in GeoGebra.

### Student Work Time

#### Problem 1

This applet has one square and some small, medium, and large right triangles. The area of the square is 1 square unit.

Click on a shape and drag to move it. Grab the point at the vertex and drag to turn it.

a. Notice that you can put together two small triangles to make a square. What is the area of the square composed of two small triangles? Be prepared to explain your reasoning.

b. Use your shapes to create a new shape with an area of 1 square unit that is not a square. Draw your shape on paper and label it with its area.

c. Use your shapes to create a new shape with an area of 2 square units. Draw your shape and label it with its area.

d. Use your shapes to create a different shape with an area of 2 square units. Draw your shape and label it with its area.

e. Use your shapes to create a new shape with an area of 4 square units. Draw your shape and label it with its area.

**Student Responses:**
a. The area of the square made from two small triangles is one square unit because it is identical to the given square with area 1 square unit. "Identical" means you can put one on top of the other and they match up exactly.

b. Any composite of two small triangles.

c. Any composite of four small triangles or two small triangles and one medium triangle. Sample responses: [Image showing compositions with area 2 square units]

d. Any composite of four small triangles or two small triangles and one medium triangle.

e. Any composite with an area of 4 square units. Sample responses: [Image showing compositions with area 4 square units]

### Anticipated Misconceptions
Students may consider the area to be the number of pieces in the compositions, instead of the number of square units. Remind them of the meaning of area, or prompt them to review the definition of area discussed in the Warm Up activity.

Because the 2 large triangles in the tangram set can be arranged to form a square, students may consider that square to be the square unit rather than the smaller square composed of 2 small triangles. Ask students to review the task statement and verify the size of the unit square.

### Activity Synthesis
Invite previously identified students (whose work illustrates the ideas shown here) to share. Name these moves explicitly as they come up: **compose**, **decompose**, and **rearrange**.

- First question: Two small triangles can be composed into a square that matches up exactly with the given square piece. This means that the two squares—the composite and the unit square—have the same area.

Tell students, "We say that if a region can be placed on top of another region so that they match up exactly, then they have the same **area**."

- Second question: Two small triangles can be rearranged to compose a different figure but the area of that composite is still 1 square unit. These three shapes—each composed of two triangles—have the same area. If we rotate the first figure, it can be placed on top of the second so that they match up exactly. The third one has a different shape than the other two, but because it is made up of the same two triangles, it has the same area.

Emphasize: "If a figure is decomposed and rearranged as a new figure, the **area** of the new figure is the same as the area of the original figure."

- Third and fourth questions: The composite figures could be formed in several ways: with only 4 small triangles, with two small triangles and a medium triangle, or with two small triangles and a square.

- Last question: A large triangle is needed here. To find its area, we need to either compose 4 smaller triangles into a large triangle, or to see that the large triangle could be decomposed into 4 smaller triangles, which can then be composed into 2 unit squares.

### Are you ready for more?

**Problem 1**

Find a way to use all of your pieces to compose a single large square. What is the area of this large square?

**Student Responses:**
The area is 8 square units. Sample response: [Image showing a composed square with area 8 square units]

## Activity 2: Tangram Triangles (15 minutes) (Optional)

**Addressing:** 6.G.A.1

### Instructional Routines
- Think Pair Share
- MLR8: Discussion Supports

In this activity, students use the areas of composite shapes from the previous activity to reason about the area of each tangram shape. Students may have recognized previously that the area of one small triangle is 1/2 square unit, the area of one medium triangle is 1 square unit, and the area of one large triangle is 2 square units. Here they practice articulating how they know that these observations are true (MP3). The explanations could be written in words, or as clearly-labeled illustrations that support their answers.

As partners discuss, look for two ways of thinking about the area of each assigned triangle: by *composing* copies of the triangle into a square or a larger triangle, or by *decomposing* the triangle or the unit square into smaller pieces and *rearranging* the pieces. Identify at least one student who uses each approach.

### Launch
Arrange students in groups of 2. Assign the first and second questions to one partner and the second and third questions to the other partner. Give each group access to the geometry toolkits and the same set of tangram pieces as used in the earlier activity.

Give students 3–4 minutes of quiet time to find the areas of their assigned triangles and to construct their explanations, followed by a few minutes to share their responses with their partner. Tell students that as one partner explains, the other should listen carefully and either agree or disagree with the explanation. They should then come to an agreement about the answers and explanations.

Classrooms using the digital activities can use an applet to assist in determining the areas of the triangles.

### Student Work Time

#### Problem 1

Recall that the area of the square you saw earlier is 1 square unit. Complete each statement and explain your reasoning.

a. The area of the small triangle is _____ square units. I know this because...

b. The area of the medium triangle is _____ square units. I know this because...

c. The area of the large triangle is _____ square units. I know this because...

**Student Responses:**
a. 1/2 square unit. Sample explanations:
   - Two small triangles can be put together to make a square, which has an area of one square unit. Because this composite shape matches the unit square exactly, their areas must be equal. This means that the area of each small triangle is half the area of the unit square.
   - A square can be decomposed into exactly two small triangles, so the area of each small triangle must be half of that of the square.

b. 1 square unit. Sample explanations:
   - Two small triangles can be put together to make one medium triangle. Two triangles can also be put together to make a square with an area of 1 square unit. Because two small triangles make both a medium triangle and a square, the area of the medium triangle must be 1 square unit.
   - One medium triangle can be decomposed into two small triangles. These can be rearranged into a square whose area is 1 square unit, so the area of the medium triangle is also 1 square unit.

c. 2 square units. Sample explanations:
   - Two medium triangles can be arranged into one large triangle. Because the area of the medium triangle is 1 square unit, a figure that is composed of two of them has area 2 square units.
   - A large triangle can be decomposed into 4 small triangles, which can in turn be rearranged into two squares. The combined area of the two squares is 2 square units.

### Anticipated Misconceptions
If students initially have trouble determining the areas of the shapes, ask how they reasoned about areas in the previous activity. Have samples of composed and decomposed shapes that form one square unit available for students to reference.

### Activity Synthesis
After partners shared and agreed on the correct areas and explanations, discuss with the class:

- "Did you and your partner use the same strategy to find the area of each triangle?"
- "How were your explanations similar? How were they different?"

Select two previously identified students to share their explanations: one who reasoned in terms of *composing* copies of their assigned triangle into another shape, and one who reasoned in terms of *decomposing* their triangle or the unit square into smaller pieces and *rearranging* them. If these approaches are not brought up by students, be sure to make them explicit at the end of the lesson.

## Lesson Synthesis

There are two principles that can help us reason about area:

1. If two figures can be placed one on top of the other so that they match up exactly, then they have the same area.

2. The area of a figure can be found by adding the areas of its parts. If we **compose** (put together) a new figure from smaller pieces without overlapping them, then the sum of the areas of the pieces is the area of the new figure. Likewise, if we **decompose** (cut or break apart) a given figure into pieces, then the area of the given figure is the sum of the areas of the pieces. Even if we **rearrange** the pieces, the overall area does not change.

Here is an example. Suppose we know the area of a small triangle and wish to find the area of a large triangle. Demonstrate the following (using the tangram pieces, if possible):

- We can use 4 small triangles to *compose* a large triangle. Here are two ways to do so. If we place a large triangle on top of a composition of 4 small triangles and they match up exactly, we know that the area of the large triangle is equal to the combined area of 4 small triangles.

[Image showing two triangles each sliced differently into 4 triangles]

- We can *decompose* the large triangle into 4 small triangles. Again, we can reason that the area of one large triangle is equal to the combined area of 4 small triangles.

[Image showing a large triangle and its decomposition into 4 small triangles]

- Suppose we don't know the area of a small triangle, but we do know the area of a square that is composed of 2 small triangles. We can *decompose* the large triangle into 4 small triangles and then *rearrange* them into 2 squares. We can reason that the area of the large triangle is equal to the combined area of 2 squares. This is because when the 4 rearranged small triangles are placed on top of two squares, they match up exactly.

[Image showing progression from large triangle to 4 small triangles to 2 squares]

We will look more deeply into these strategies in the next lesson.

## Cool Down: Tangram Rectangle (5 minutes)

### Student Work Time

#### Problem 1

The square in the middle has an area of 1 square unit. What is the area of the entire rectangle in square units? Explain your reasoning.

[Image showing a rectangle composed of 2 small tangram triangles, 2 medium tangram triangles, and 1 tangram square]

**Student Responses:**
The area is 4 square units. Possible strategies:

- Put together the two small triangles to make a square. Its area is 1 square unit. Decompose each medium triangle into two small triangles that can be arranged as a square. Each of these squares has area 1 square unit. Together with the square in the middle, the sum of the areas of these pieces is 4 square units.
- A small triangle has an area of 1/2 square unit, and a medium triangle has an area of 1 square unit. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 4

### Responding to Student Thinking

#### More Chances
Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this Cool Down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this Cool Down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.
