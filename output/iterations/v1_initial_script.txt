voiceover : "Today you'll learn how to find the area of a shape by decomposing it into smaller, simpler shapes, and rearranging the pieces. This is a powerful method that will help you solve complex problems later on."

voiceover : "Watch closely as I model this concept with a simple example. Suppose we have a rectangle that's divided into two squares and two triangles."
screen : 'Slide displays a rectangle divided into two squares and two triangles.'

voiceover : "To find the area of this rectangle, we first identify the areas of the simpler shapes within it. We know that the area of a square is length times width, and the area of a triangle is one half base times height."
screen : 'Slide shows the formula for area of a square and triangle, with relevant parts of the shapes highlighted.'

voiceover : "Let's say the side length of each square is 2 units, and the base and height of each triangle is also 2 units. So, the area of each square is 2 times 2, which is 4 square units. The area of each triangle is one half times 2 times 2, which is 2 square units."
screen : 'Slide displays calculations for the area of each square and triangle.'

voiceover : "Now, to find the total area of the rectangle, we add up the areas of the squares and triangles. That's 4 plus 4 plus 2 plus 2, which equals 12 square units."
screen : 'Slide shows the addition of the areas of the squares and triangles to find the total area of the rectangle.'

voiceover : "Now let's try a second example together. Suppose we have a rectangle that's divided into three squares and two triangles. Can you calculate the areas of these shapes and add them up to find the total area of the rectangle?"
screen : 'Slide shows a new example of a rectangle divided into three squares and two triangles. The side length of each square and the base and height of each triangle are all 3 units.'

voiceover : "[pause] Great job! Let's see if you got it right. The area of each square is 3 times 3, which is 9 square units. The area of each triangle is one half times 3 times 3, which is 4.5 square units. Adding these up, we get a total area of 31.5 square units."
screen : 'Slide shows the calculations for the area of each square and triangle, and the total area of the rectangle.'

voiceover : "Now it's your turn. Try finding the area of a shape by decomposing it into smaller shapes and rearranging the pieces. Remember, practice makes perfect!"
screen : 'Slide displays a new shape for students to practice on, along with a reminder of the steps to take.'
